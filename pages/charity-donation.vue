      <h1 class="title">Charity Donations</h1>
      <p>The family and friends of Baron David Ward are requesting donations in lieu of flowers for The Natural Death Centre ("NDC")(Registered Charity Number: 1091396) who have been an amazing support throughout these last few weeks and we would like to give back to them.</p>
      <h2>Natural Death Centre</h2>
      <p> Nothing was too much trouble for Rosie at the NDC and her expertise, know-how and truthfulness was very much appreciated when obstacles were placed in the way of us  carrying out David's wishes. We are very grateful for her time, support and patience with us and for her above and beyond kindness and advice which extended out of office hours. Thank you Rosie and the NDC. We know David would be so proud we found you.</p>
      <p> Below is an excerpt from Prof. Tony Walter's Foreword in the Natural Death Handbook (5th Edition)</p>

<blockquote>From being an irritant of the funeral industry, the NDC is now working in partnership with it, or at least with some sections of it. This is evidence of success, but the NDC's role as a radical clearinghouse of innovative ideas must continue, and this book is evidence of that. Staying at the leading edge, whilst at the same time bringing up the troops from the rear, is quite a challenge! So here's a radical idea of my own, though I am sure I am not the first to have thought of it, and I hope someone has already tried to implement it. It concerns the challenge to ensure that those who provide services for the dying are scrutinised as effectively as the NDC is scrutinising those who provide services for the dead. As I write (October 2011), the Care Quality Commission has reported truly appalling lack of care for elderly people in too many hospitals in Britain. If care is something those near the end of life might naturally expect, then what goes on in many hospitals is disturbingly unnatural. Natural dying should be dying surrounded by care. Relying on formal inspections clearly doesn't guarantee this. I would like to see official inspection supplemented by a rash of unofficial websites where people can rate not only their experience of the quality of funeral directors and burial grounds, but also the care provided by social care services, hospitals, old people's homes and nursing homes. Sure, as with online ratings of hotels or restaurants or books, online ratings are subjective and can on occasion cause unnecessary damage, and they can be manipulated. But the overall effect on anyone and any organisation being paid to care for those approaching the end of life would be palpable. Some business and professional people may fear this would lead to anarchy. I hope it does! Though many people associate anarchy with chaos and disorder, the theory of anarchy challenges rule by those who think they know better than us how to run our own lives (or deaths), and proposes instead 'the co-operative and voluntary association of individuals and groups as the principal mode of organised society' (dicitionary.com). That is pretty much what the NDC has been fighting for in regard to family-organised dying and funerals. 'Co-operative and voluntary association' exactly characterises a family organised deathbed or burial. If death and dying are to be re-owned by communities, by families and by individuals, helped along of course by professional expertise, it will be in part because the NDC continues to take forward Nicholas Albery's anarchic vision of providing to the public information that had previously been kept from them.</blockquote>>
