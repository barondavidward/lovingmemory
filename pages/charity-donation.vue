      <p>The family and friends of Baron David Ward are requesting donations in lieu of flowers for The Natural Death Centre ("NDC")(Registered Charity Number: 1091396) who have been an amazing support throughout these last few weeks and we would like to give back to them.</p>
      <h2>Natural Death Centre</h2>
      <p> Nothing was too much trouble for Rosie at the NDC and her expertise, know-how and truthfulness was very much appreciated when obstacles were placed in the way of us  carrying out David's wishes. We are very grateful for her time, support and patience with us and for her above and beyond kindness and advice which extended out of office hours. Thank you Rosie and the NDC. We know David would be so proud we found you.</p>
