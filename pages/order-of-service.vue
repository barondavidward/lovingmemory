      <p><em>Saturday 5th June 2021</em> Due to COVID-19 the service is restricted in the number of people allowed. The plan is to live-stream the service so everyone who wants to attend will be able to do so virtually. We will also hold a celebration of light and music offerings after the service.</p>
      <p class="highlight">The family and friends wish to express their appreciation for the kindness, sympathy, and support which has been extended to them in their bereavement.</p>
